# surfs_up
## Overview
  * For this project it was necessary to find more information about temperature trends before opening a theoretical surf shop. Specifically, we have to uncover temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu from a sqlite database, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
  
## Results
  * Key differences in weather between June and December
   * June summary stats:

   * December summary stats:

  * Minimum temperatures between June and December are 64 and 56 degrees Fahrenheit, respectively.
  * Maximum temperatures between June and december are 85 and 83 degrees Fahrenheit, respectively.
  * The standard deviation for June was 3.25 vs 3.75 in December, giving a 0.5 difference between both months (seasons)
## Summary
  * Based on the data retrieved from the analysis, the month of June would be the best time to open up the shop, however business could prove to be viable year-round.
